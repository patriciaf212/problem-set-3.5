    <h1>Volleyball Skills</h1>
    <h2>Serving</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When you serve, you are tossing a ball in front of you. You then contact the center of the ball with the palm of your hand.</li>
      <li>This skill allows for a game or rally to begin.</li>
      <li>Serving is very important since it starts a game.</li>
      <li>Serving is the only part of the game where you have full control.</li>
      <li>Some types of serves are standing float serve, TopSpin, Jump Float, and Jump TopSpin.</li
    </ul>

    <h2>Passing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To pass a ball, your forearms are together, creating a platform. To get the perfect pass, the ball must contact that platform and you should use your legs to allow the ball to go higher.</li>
      <li>Passing is also a very important skill.</li>
      <li>A play always begins with a pass.</li>
      <li>If there is no pass, then the setter cannot set up the hitter to attack the ball.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hitting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When you hit a ball, you take an approach and jump up to hit the ball above the height of the net. The ball should be hit down to court.</li>
      <li>Hitting is usually the third touch and should go over the net.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Blocking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blocking is an attempt to prevent the opponent's hit to come over the net.</li>
      <li>When you block, you should be inline with the hitter and jump to get your hands above and over the net.</li>
      <li>Blocking also helps take off the speed of the hit and helps the backrow players to pass the ball.</li>
    </ul>

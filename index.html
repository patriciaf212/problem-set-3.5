    <h1>What is Volleyball?</h1>
      <p>Volleyball is a team sport, in which two teams (consisting of 6 players each) are on different sides of the court to try
        to score a point by using their forearms or arms to hit a ball over a net and make the ball touch the ground of opponents
        playing area. A volleyball match is divided into sets. Each set is 25 points. The first team to reach 25 points wins. Each
        team was allowed 3 ball contacts before sending the ball over. The ball had to be sent over by the third contact. Before
        the serve, the team serving rotates clockwise. The game is played with a net that is 7 feet and 11 inches for men and 7 ft
        and four in for women. The court is 59 ft x 29.5 ft. Volleyball involves many skills and communication between the team. </p>

    <h1>History of Volleyball</h1>
      <p>The sport of volleyball was created by William G. Morgan, who was the director of physical education at the Young Man Christian
        Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Morgan created the sport in 1895 and the original name was Mintonette. Ideas
        from handball and tennis were used to play volleyball. The net was 6ft and 6in high and the court was 25ft x 50ft. There was
        no limit to how many players were allowed on the court. In each match, there were 9 innings and each team were allowed 3
        serves in each inning. There were also not limits to how many ball contacts before sending the ball over.</p>
